FileQuest
=========

This plugin accesses Spotlight indexes on OS X and locate indexes on linux. It assumes that the 
rails server has access to properly running SpotLight and Locate services and file shares.

On Mac OS X it can access both the content and the name of files. On linux only the name is searched.

On Mac OS X you can also use the same search filters like...

kind:pdf, kind:jpeg, kind:word, kind:folder, kind:image, kind:audio, date:today, date:yesterday


How To Install
==============

script/plugin install git://github.com/cpanderson/FileQuest.git

start/restart rails server
