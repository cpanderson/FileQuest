FileQuest
=========

This plugin accesses Spotlight indexes on OS X and locate indexes on linux. It assumes that the 
rails server has access to properly running SpotLight and Locate services and file shares.

On Mac OS X it can access both the content and the name of files. On linux only the name is searched.

On Mac OS X you can also use the same search filters like...

kind:pdf, kind:jpeg, kind:word, kind:folder, kind:image, kind:audio, date:today, date:yesterday

Usage: FileQuest::Search.new(<directory path for search>, <search term>, <options>)

Options:
		:name_only => (true||false)   ...search for file name only, not contents (Spotlight only), default = true
		
Examples
=======

@files = FileQuest::Search.new("/Shared/Public", "stuff", {:name_only => false})

@files = FileQuest::Search.new("/Projects", "invoices kind:pdf") 

Methods: 
		@files.dir 		"Shared/Public"
		@files.query	"stuff"
		@files.options  "{:name_only => true}"
		@files.command  <returns command used to execute search>
		@files.search   <executes search>
